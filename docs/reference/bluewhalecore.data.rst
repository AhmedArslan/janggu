bluewhalecore.data - Genomics datasets for deep learning
===================


This section describes several datasets that act as a bridge between
raw genomics datasets (e.g. DNA sequence from a fasta file, or genome-wide coverage
information from a bam-file) and the dataformat applications directly for a deep learning
application.
